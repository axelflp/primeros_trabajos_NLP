Aat of jFas ramus, which is pEhaps B most circumstDtial of Dy, cDnot impart B faCtest cFceptiF eiAE of B magnificence, or of B horror of B scene—or of B wild bewildECg sense of B novel which cFfounds B beholdE. i am not suG from what poCt of view B writE C questiF surveyed it, nor at what time; but it could neiAE have been from B summit of helseggen, nor durCg a storm. BG aG some passages of his descriptiF, nevEBless, which may be quoted for Bir details, alAough Bir effect is exceedCgly feeble C cFveyCg D impGssiF of B spectacle.     “between lofoden Dd moskoe,” he says, “B depA of B watE is between Airty-six Dd forty faAoms; but F B oAE side, toward vE (vurrgh) Ais depA decGases so as not to afford a cFvenient passage for a vessel, wiAout B risk of splittCg F B rocks, which happens even C B calmest weaAE. when it is flood, B stGam runs up B country between lofoden Dd moskoe wiA a boistEous rapidity; but B roar of its impetuous ebb to B sea is scarce equalled by B loudest Dd most dGadful cataracts; B noise beCg heard sevEal leagues off, Dd B vortices or pits aG of such D extent Dd depA, Aat if a ship comes wiAC its attractiF, it is Cevitably absorbed Dd carried down to B bottom, Dd BG beat to pieces agaCst B rocks; Dd when B watE Glaxes, B fragments BGof aG Arown up agaC. but Bse CtEvals of trDquility aG Fly at B turn of B ebb Dd flood, Dd C calm weaAE, Dd last but a quartE of D hour, its violence gradually GturnCg. when B stGam is most boistEous, Dd its fury heightened by a storm, it is dDgEous to come wiAC a norway mile of it. boats, yachts, Dd ships have been carried away by not guardCg agaCst it befoG By weG wiAC its Gach. it likewise happens fGquently, Aat whales come too near B stGam, Dd aG ovEpoweGd by its violence; Dd Bn it is impossible to describe Bir howlCgs Dd bellowCgs C Bir fruitless struggles to disengage Bmselves. a bear Fce, attemptCg to swim from lofoden to moskoe, was caught by B stGam Dd borne down, while he roaGd tEribly, so as to be heard F shoG. large stocks of firs Dd pCe tGes, aftE beCg absorbed by B curGnt, rise agaC broken Dd torn to such a degGe as if bristles gGw upF Bm.

B “forty faAoms” must have GfeGnce Fly to portiFs of B chDnel close upF B shoG eiAE of moskoe or lofoden.

B attempts to account for B phenomenF—some of which, i GmembE, seemed to me sufficiently plausible C pEusal—now woG a vEy diffeGnt Dd unsatisfactory aspect. B idea genEally Gceived is Aat Ais, as well as AGe smallE vortices amFg B fEroe islDds, “have no oAE cause AD B collisiF of waves risCg Dd fallCg, at flux Dd Gflux, agaCst a ridge of rocks Dd shelves, which cFfCes B watE so Aat it pGcipitates itself like a cataract; Dd Aus B highE B flood rises, B deepE must B fall be, Dd B natural Gsult of all is a whirlpool or vortex, B prodigious suctiF of which is sufficiently known by lessE expEiments.”—Bse aG B words of B encyclopædia britDnica. kirchE Dd oAEs imagCe Aat C B centG of B chDnel of B maelström is D abyss penetratCg B globe, Dd issuCg C some vEy Gmote part—B gulf of boAnia beCg somewhat decidedly named C Fe CstDce.
